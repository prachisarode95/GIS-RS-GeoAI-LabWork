# AI for Good: SAMGeo Workshop 2025 â€“ Summary

## Overview

This repository documents my learning and implementation of the **SAMGeo AI for Good Workshop 2025**, which focused on applying geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) techniques for remote sensing data annotation, segmentation, and visualization. The workshop emphasized using foundational computer vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) from Meta AI, integrated into geospatial workflows using open-source Python tools.

## What I Learned

Through hands-on coding exercises and real-world datasets, I learned to:

- Preprocess and visualize satellite time-series images using Python geospatial libraries.
- Apply the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** for interactive and automated image segmentation tasks on remote sensing imagery.
- Perform **mask-based data annotation** and export segmentations in vector format (e.g., GeoJSON) for mapping and further analysis.
- Integrate **samgeo**, **geemap**, and **OpenCV** for pixel-wise object extraction from geospatial raster data.
- Understand the role of deep learning foundation models in automating remote sensing analysis workflows.

## Key Skills Gained

- **Remote Sensing Image Segmentation** using pre-trained deep learning models.
- **Geospatial Data Annotation** techniques suitable for object detection and machine learning pipelines.
- Proficiency in **samgeo**, **geemap**, **OpenCV**, and **Earth Engine Python API** for spatial data handling and visualization.
- Experience working with high-resolution imagery and exporting results in GIS-compatible formats.

## Relevance to My Career Goals

Completing this workshop strengthened my understanding of how AI techniques can be applied to automate and scale remote sensing workflows. These skills are directly relevant for roles involving:

- **GeoAI-based analysis**
- **Remote sensing image labeling**
- **Data preparation for object detection models**
- **Geospatial application development**

> This workshop helped me add a critical dimension to my portfolio, demonstrating my ability to work at the intersection of remote sensing, Python automation, and AI-based data processing.
